(* Example of how Case is used *)
Theorem andb_true_elim1 : forall b c : bool,

Proof.

(* This is where we use induction! *)

(* If P(n) is some proposition involving a natural number n
  and we want to show that P holds for all numbers n
    show that P(0) holds
    show that for any n', if P(n') holds, so does P(S n')
    conclude that P(n) holds for all n

(* In Coq, the steps are the same, but the order is backwards!
    Prove P(n) for all n by breaking down into two separate subgoals
      show P(0)
